# LCOE, Levelised Cost of Energy Model
This project will provide an open source methodology for calculating the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) for a range of energy technologies. 

Over time I will be uploading and documenting a variety of different versions of the model in order to provide transparency and consistency across a range of frameworks. This project will also supply each version in a range of languages so that the LCOE model can be implemented across a range of use cases. 

Previously this model and its successors has been used to examine a range of policy and new technology options for Australia, Indian and Russia.
